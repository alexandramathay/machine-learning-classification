# Overview machine-learning-classification
The goal of this multi-class classification machine learning project is to build a model that is able to predict the forest cover type, which is the predominant type of tree cover, from cartographic variables.
There are seven different cover types, namely, 1 = Spruce/Fir, 2 = Lodgepole Pine, 3 = Ponderosa Pine, 4 = Cottonwood/Willow, 5 = Aspen, and 6 = Douglas-fir &amp; 7 =Krummholz.
In this project we will go through the machine learning process of understanding the data, followed by data cleaning and preparation, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, then optimization, to find the best model to predict the classes.
## how to run the model
To run the model you need to download the jupyter notebook called forest_covertype_final_model.ipynb as well as the train and test csv files inside the datasets folder.
